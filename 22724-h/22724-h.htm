<h2>SMALL BY DEGREES.</h2>

<h3><i>A Story of Defiance not Defence.</i></h3>

<p>There was once a Battalion of Volunteers with
its full complement of field, company, and non-commissioned
officers, and rank and file. And
according to experts the Regiment was a most
valuable addition to the national defence. One
day a General, covered over with gold lace and
wearing a cocked hat, rode up to the Colonel and
called him out.</p>

<p>"Colonel," said the General, "we are thinking
of giving over your command to a C.O. of a D&eacute;p&ocirc;t
Centre. It won't interfere with you much and
give you less to do. You may still call yourself
Colonel&mdash;not that I call you so myself. I mean
off parade."</p>

<p>But the Colonel did not seem to see it, and so
he sent in his papers and rode away.</p>

<p>Then the General from the War Office called up
the two remaining Field Officers.</p>

<p>"Majors" said he, "it seems to us we can help
you a good deal by appointing a Major from a
service battalion as Adjutant. Then you can
rank beneath him, and he can look after you and
the two half battalions you each of you are supposed
to command. You may still call yourselves
Majors&mdash;not that I call you so myself. I mean off
parade."</p>

<p>But the Majors did not seem to
see it, so they sent in <i>their</i> papers
too.</p>

<p>Then the General from the War
Office called up the Company Officers.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "we shall
continue the snubbing, of which you
have had so much experience. You
will do all sorts of new work, and
go to all sorts of fresh expense in the
near future. Not that it will increase
your dignity&mdash;not a bit of it.
However, you may still call yourselves
Captains and Lieutenants&mdash;not
that I call you so myself. I mean
off parade."</p>

<p>But the Company Officers did not
seem to see it, so they sent in their
papers and marched away. Then
the General from the War Office
called up the rest of the Regiment.</p>

<p>"Now, Non-commissioned Officers
and Men," said he, "you have no one
to command you, and no one to pay
for your marches out, prizes, and the
rest of it. But don't let that bother
you. You may still call yourselves
Soldiers&mdash;not that I call you
so myself. I mean off parade."</p>

<p>But the remainder of the Regiment
did not seem to see it, so they sent
in <i>their</i> resignations, and vanished.</p>

<p>Then the Officer from the War
Office rode towards Pall Mall.</p>

<p>"It won't interfere with me
much," said he, "and give the Department
less to do. And I can
still call myself General&mdash;though I
scarcely deserve the title, either on
or off parade!"</p>

<h2>THE WITLER'S WISION OF WENGEANCE.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="sc">In a slightly Pickwickian Sense</span>.)</h3>
<p><i>Being the Dream of an angry "Brother Bung" after attending the Meeting at St. James's Hall, and trying to soothe himself with a dip into
Dickens.</i></p>

</div><br /><br />



<p>["He" Lord <span class="sc">Burton</span>, "asked why this drastic, this dishonest, this
catchpenny, this gerrymandering Bill should have been brought in?....
They had heard much of late about the Nonconformist Conscience, which
was said to be the backbone of the Liberal Party. He firmly believed that
the Bill had been brought forward to suit the Nonconformist Conscience,
to pander to the hypocritical self-righteousness, and the sham respectability
of a certain class."&mdash;<i>Lord Burton, at the St. James's Hall Meeting, on the
Direct Veto Bill.</i>]</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, the elder, gave vent to an extraordinary sound,
which, being neither a groan, nor a grunt, nor a gasp, nor a howl,
nor a hoot, nor a hiss, nor a shout, nor a shriek, yet seemed to partake
in some degree of the character of all these inarticulate laryngeal
exercises. It was a big vocal blend, and a stentorian; it made him
pant and turn apoplectically purple in the face, it shook the house,
and very nearly "brought it down."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Witler's</span> "wocal wagaries" (as his son called them)
when he <i>was</i> roused, were something tremendous, earthquaky,
appalling!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Swigslop Stiggins</span>, a leading Shepherd of the Nonconformist
Rechabite Flock, unwarned by this nondescript sound, which he
understood to betoken remorse or repentance, in fact, an awakening
of the "Nonconformist Conscience," in a somewhat unlikely quarter,
looked about him, rubbed his hands, wept, smiled, wept again, and
then mechanically uttering a guttural "Hear! Hear!" (as though
he were listening, in the House of Commons, to the jocund <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>,
or the jocular <span class="sc">Lawson</span>, or the robustious T. W. <span class="sc">Russell</span>, or the
astute <span class="sc">Caine</span>) and then, walking across the room to a well-remembered
pigeon-hole, took thence an official-looking scroll, sat down,
formally unfolded it, cleared his throat, and began with pompous
complacency to read aloud its title, preamble, clauses, and provisions,
compulsory regulations, and peremptory prohibitions to the
apparently semi-asphyxiated Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, who still continued to make various
strange and uncouth attempts to appear indifferent, offered not a
single word during these proceedings; but when <span class="sc">Stiggins</span> stopped
for breath, previous to a second reading, he darted upon him, and,
snatching the scroll from his hand, first buffeted him briskly about
the head therewith, and then threw it into the fire. Then, seizing
the astonished gentleman firmly by the collar, he suddenly fell to
kicking him most furiously, accompanying every application of his
boots to Mr. <span class="sc">Stiggins's</span> person with sundry violent and incoherent
anathemas, such as&mdash;"Blatant Barabbas!"&mdash;"Bumptious busybody!"&mdash;"Unblushing
bandit!"&mdash;"Barefaced spoliator!"&mdash;"Hypocritical
humbug!"&mdash;"Iniquitous inquisitor!"&mdash;"Fanatical
faddist!"&mdash;"Self-righteous sneak!"&mdash;"Sham
saint!"&mdash;"Jerrymandering <span class="sc">Jeremy Diddler</span>!"&mdash;"Pragmatical
pump!"&mdash;"Little Bethelite Boanerges!" and "Nonconformist
<i>Tartuffe</i>!!!"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sammy</span>," said Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, "put my cap on tight for me!"
<span class="sc">Sam</span> dutifully adjusted the cap more firmly on his father's head,
and the old gentleman, resuming his kicking with greater agility
than before, tumbled Mr. <span class="sc">Stiggins</span> through the bar, and through
the passage, out at the front door, and so into the street, the kicking
continuing the whole way, and increasing in vehemence rather than
diminishing every time the boot was lifted.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight (<i>to "the Trade"</i>) to see
the water-drinker writhing in Mr. <span class="sc">Witler's</span> grasp, and his whole
frame quivering with anguish as kick followed kick in rapid succession;
it was a still more exciting spectacle (<i>to Bungdom all round,
from boisterous</i> Lord <span class="sc">Burton</span> <i>to the humblest rural Boniface</i>)
to
behold Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, after a powerful struggle, immersing Mr.
<span class="sc">Stiggins's</span> head in a horse-trough full of water, and holding it there
until he was half suffocated.</p>

<p>"There!" said Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, throwing all his energy into one
most complicated kick, as he at length permitted Mr. <span class="sc">Stiggins</span>
to withdraw his head from the trough, "send any vun o' them
villainous Vetoists, from burly Sir <span class="sc">Villiam Barabbas</span> hisself
down to the pettifoggingest Local Hoptioniser in Little Peddlington,
<i>here</i>, or to St. James's 'All, or the Alhambra, or elseveres
in public meeting or privit pub, and I'll pound him to a argymentative
jelly fust, and drownd him in public-speritted opinion
arterwards!"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sammy</span>" (added Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, puffing and perspiring freely),
"help me in, and fill me a stiff glass o' Speshal Scotch; for I'm out
of breath, my boy!"</p>

<h2>PILL-DOCTOR HERDAL.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Translated from the Original Norwegian by Mr. Punch.</i>)</h4>

<h3>THIRD ACT.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
<i>On the right, a smart verandah, attached to</i> Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal's</span> <i>dwelling-house,
and communicating with the Drawing-room and Dispensary
by glass-doors. On the left a tumble-down rockery, with
a headless plaster Mercury. In front, a lawn, with a large
silvered glass globe on a stand. Chairs and tables. All the
furniture is of galvanised iron. A sunset is seen going on
among the trees.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dr. Herdal</i> (<i>comes out of Dispensary-door cautiously, and
whispers</i>). <span class="sc">Hilda</span>, are you in there?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Taps with fingers on Drawing-room door.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>comes out with a half-teasing smile</i>). Well&mdash;and how is
the Rainbow-powder getting on, Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i>
(<i>with enthusiasm</i>).
It is getting
on simply
splendidly. I
sent the new
Assistant out to
take a little
walk, so that he
should not be in
the way. There
is Arsenic in the
powder, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>,
and Digitalis
too, and Strychnine,
and the best Beetle-killer!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with happy, wondering eyes</i>). <i>Lots</i> of
Beetle-killer? And you will give some of it
to <i>her</i>, to make her free and buoyant. I
think one really <i>has</i> the right&mdash;when people
happen to stand in the way&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Yes, you may well say so, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>.
Still&mdash;(<i>dubiously</i>)&mdash;it <i>does</i> occur to me that
such doings may perhaps be misunderstood&mdash;by
the narrow-minded and conventional.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>They go on the lawn, and sit down.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with an outburst</i>). Oh, that all seems
to me so foolish&mdash;so irrelevant! As if the
whole thing wasn't intended as an Allegory!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Ah, so long as it is
merely <i>allegorical</i> of course&mdash;&mdash; But what is
it an allegory <i>of</i>, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>reflects in vain</i>). How can you sit
there and ask such questions? I suppose I am
a symbol, of some sort.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>as a thought flashes upon him</i>).
A cymbal? That would certainly account for
your bra&mdash;&mdash; Then am <i>I</i> a cymbal too, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Why yes&mdash;what else? You represent
the Artist-worker, or the Elder Generation,
or the Pursuit of the Ideal, or a Bilious
Conscience&mdash;or something or other. <i>You</i>'re
all right!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>shakes his head</i>). Am I? But I
don't quite see&mdash;&mdash; Well, well, cymbals are
meant to clash a little. And I see plainly now
that I ought to prescribe this powder for as
many as possible. Isn't it terrible, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>,
that so many poor souls never really die their
own deaths&mdash;pass out of the world without
even the formality of an inquest? As the
district Coroner, I feel strongly on the subject.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> And, when the Coroner has finished
sitting on all the bodies, perhaps&mdash;but I shan't
tell you now. (<i>Speaks as if to a child.</i>) There, run away and finish
making the Rainbow-powder, do!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>skips up into the Dispensary</i>). I will&mdash;I will! Oh,
I do feel such a troll&mdash;such a light-haired, light-headed old devil!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>enters garden-gate</i>). I have had my dismissal&mdash;but I'm
not going without saying good-bye to Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> would disapprove&mdash;you really must not, Mr.
<span class="sc">Kalomel</span>. And, besides, Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> is not at home. She is in
the town buying me a reel of cotton. <i>Dr.</i> <span class="sc">Herdal</span> is in. He is
making real Rainbow powders for regenerating everybody all round.
Won't <i>that</i> be fun?</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub.</i> <i>Making</i> powders? Ha! ha! But you will see he won't
<i>take</i> one himself. It is quite notorious to us younger men that he
simply daren't do it.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> (<i>with a little snort of contempt</i>). Oh, I daresay&mdash;that's so
likely! (<i>Defiantly.</i>) I know he <i>can</i>, though. I've <i>seen</i>
him!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub.</i> There is a tradition that he once&mdash;but not now&mdash;he knows
better. I think you said Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> was in the town? I will go

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>calls</i>). Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>! Come out this minute. I want
you&mdash;awfully!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>puts his head out</i>). Just when I am making such
wonderful progress with the powder! (<i>Comes down and leans on a
table.</i>) Have you hit upon some way of giving it to <span class="sc">Aline</span>? I
thought if you were to put it in her arrowroot&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> No, thanks. I won't have that now. I have just
recollected that it is a rule of mine never to injure anybody I have
once been formally introduced to. Strangers don't count. No, poor
Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> mustn't take that powder!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Then is nothing to come of making
Rainbow powders, after all, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>looks hard at him</i>). People
say you are afraid to take your own
physic. Is that true?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Yes, I am. (<i>After a
pause&mdash;with candour.</i>) I find it invariably
disagrees with me.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with a half-dubious smile</i>).
I think I can understand <i>that</i>. But
you did <i>once</i>. You swallowed your
own pills that day at the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>,
ten years ago. And I heard a harp
in the air, too!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>open-mouthed</i>). I don't
think that <i>could</i> have been Me. I
don't play any instrument. And
that was quite a special thing, too.
It's not every day I can do it. Those
were only <i>bread</i> pills, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with flashing eyes</i>). But
you rolled them; you took them.
And I want to see you stand once
more free and high and great, swallowing
your own preparations.
(<i>Passionately.</i>) I <i>will</i> have you do
it! (<i>Imploringly.</i>) Just <i>once</i> more,
Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> If I did, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>, my
medical knowledge, slight as it is,
leads me to the conclusion that I
should in all probability burst.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>looks deeply into his eyes</i>).
So long as you burst <i>beautifully</i>!
But no doubt that Miss <span class="sc">Blakdraf</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> You must believe in
me utterly and entirely. I will do
anything&mdash;<i>anything</i>, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>, to provide
you with agreeable entertainment.
I <i>will</i> swallow my own
powder! (<i>To himself, as he goes
gravely up to Dispensary.</i>) If only
the drugs are sufficiently adulterated!</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Senna Blakdraf</i> (<i>comes wildly out

Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>? Oh, Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span>,
he has discharged me&mdash;but I can't&mdash;I
simply <i>can't</i> live away from that
lovely ledger!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>jubilantly</i>). At this moment Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> is in the
Dispensary,
taking one of his own powders.</p>

<p><i>Senna</i> (<i>despairingly</i>). But&mdash;but it is utterly impossible! Miss
<span class="sc">Wangel</span>, you have such a firm hold of him&mdash;<i>don't</i> let him do
that!</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> I have already done all I can.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">R&uuml;bub</span> <i>appears, talking confidentially with Mrs.</i> <span class="sc">Herdal</span>, <i>at

<p><i>Senna.</i> Oh, Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal, R&uuml;bub</span>! The Pill-Doctor is going to
take one of his own preparations. Save him&mdash;quick!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>with cold politeness</i>). I am sorry to hear it&mdash;for his
sake. But it would be quite contrary to professional etiquette to
prevent him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> And I never interfere with my husband's proceedings.
I know <i>my</i> duty, Miss <span class="sc">Blakdraf</span>, if <i>others</i> don't!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>exulting with great intensity</i>). At last! Now I see him
in there, great and free again, mixing the powder in a spoon&mdash;with
jam!.... Now he raises the spoon. Higher&mdash;higher still!
(<i>A gulp is audible from within.</i>) There, didn't you hear a harp
in the air? (<i>Quietly.</i>) I can't see the spoon any more. But
there is one he is striving with, in blue spectacles!</p>

<p><i>The New Assistant's Voice</i> (<i>within</i>). The Pill-Doctor

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>as if petrified</i>). That voice! <i>Where</i> have I heard it

thrilling! My&mdash;<i>my</i> Pill-Doctor!</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> (<i>comes out on verandah</i>). I am happy to inform you
that&mdash;as, to avoid accidents, I took the simple precaution of filling
all the Dispensary-jars with Camphorated Chalk&mdash;no serious results
may be anticipated from Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal's</span> rashness. (<i>Removes
spectacles.</i>)
<span class="sc">Nora</span>, don't you know me?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>reflects</i>). I really don't remember having the
pleasure&mdash;&mdash;And
I'm <i>sure</i> I heard a harp in the air!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> I fancy, Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span>, it must have been merely
a bee in your bonnet!</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> (<i>tenderly</i>). Still the same little singing-bird! Oh,
<span class="sc">Nora</span>, my long-lost lark!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>sulky</i>). I'm <i>not</i> a lark&mdash;I'm a Bird of Prey&mdash;and,
when
I get my claws into anything&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> Macaroons, for instance? I remember your tastes of
old. See, <span class="sc">Nora</span>! (<i>Produces a paper-bag from his coat-tail
pocket.</i>)
They were fresh this morning!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>wavering</i>). If you insist on calling me <span class="sc">Nora</span>, I
think you
must be just a little mad yourself.</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> We are all a little mad&mdash;in Norway. But <span class="sc">Torvald
Helmer</span> is sane enough still to recognise his own little squirrel
again! Surely, <span class="sc">Nora</span>, your education is complete at last&mdash;you have
gained the experience you needed?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>nods slowly</i>). Yes, <span class="sc">Torvald</span>, you're right enough
<i>there</i>.
I have thought things out for myself, and have got clear about
them. And I have quite made up my mind that Society and the
Law are all wrong, and that I am right.</p>

<p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>overjoyed</i>). Then you <i>have</i> learnt the Great Lesson,
and are
fit to undertake the charge of your children's education at last!
You've no notion how they've grown! Yes, <span class="sc">Nora</span>, our marriage
will be a true marriage now. You will come back to the Doll's-House,
won't you?</p>

<p><i>Hilda-Nora-Helmer-Wangel</i> (<i>hesitates</i>). Will you let me forge
cheques if I do, <span class="sc">Torvald</span>?</p>

<p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>ardently</i>). All day. And at night, <span class="sc">Nora</span>, we will
falsify the accounts&mdash;together!</p>

<p><i>H. N. H. W.</i> (<i>throws herself into his arms, and helps herself
to macaroons</i>). That will be fearfully thrilling! My&mdash;<i>my</i>

<p><i>Helmer.</i> Not in the least. But this lady is my little lark, and she
is going back to her cage by the next steamer.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). Am I <i>never</i> to have a gleam of

But stay&mdash;do I see my little <span class="sc">Senna</span> once more?</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub.</i> Pardon me&mdash;<i>my</i> little <span class="sc">Senna</span>. She always believed so

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Well&mdash;well. If it must be. <span class="sc">R&uuml;bub</span>, I will take you
into partnership, and we will take out a patent for that pill, jointly.
<span class="sc">Aline</span>, my poor dear <span class="sc">Aline</span>, let us try once more if we cannot

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i><span class="sc">Burdett's</span> Official Intelligence for</i> 1893 is just out, a
promising
young thing in its twelfth year. It is a little early to talk of the
holidays, but my Baronite, regarding this thin Vol. of 1783 pages,
says he cannot help thinking with what pleasure the City merchant,
or his clerk, hastening to the seaside, will pack it up with his
collar-box. Every year the monumental work increases in value,
by reason of accumulated information. To the tired City man, scaling
some Alp, gliding in well-found yacht over silver seas, or prone in
bosky dell, there can be nothing more soothing or delightful than to
take his "<span class="sc">Burdett</span>" out of his waistcoat-pocket, and read it through
from first page to last.</p>

<p>For <i>The Tragedy of Ida Noble</i> the Baron tenders his grateful
thanks to <span class="sc">W. Clark Russell</span>. It starts well, and the excitement is
artistically sustained. At the close of every chapter <i>Oliver</i>, the
reader, is perpetually "asking for more." A capital story of
adventure, where all, including the reader, are "quite at sea" until
the very last chapter. On nearing the middle of the book, the
question will occur to everyone experienced in such matters, "Does
the hero marry the heroine?" Now this, being a lady's secret,
will not be revealed by <span class="sc">The Baron de B.-W.</span></p>

<p>In the Agony-Column of the <i>Times</i> we now see daily the
following Advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<p>TO IRISH LOYALISTS AND PROTESTANTS.&mdash;<span class="sc">Death before
Slavery!</span></p>

<p>Surely a most blameless sentiment. But the bearings of it lie in
the application. And what is that? It seems as applicable to any
existing situation as, say, "Lunch before Dinner," or "Business
before Pleasure," or "Age before Honesty," or "Fingers before
forks." <i>Mr. Punch</i> ventures to suggest a modification, less striking,
perhaps, in an "Agony-Column," but more in accord with
patriotism and common-sense:&mdash;</p>

<p class="i10"><i>Be</i> Loyal, and Protest&mdash;<i>Constitutionally</i>!</p>

<p>The flamboyant, melodramatic, "Death before Slavery!" <i>may</i> be
applicable&mdash;when "Slavery" becomes a conceivable, proximate
probability, or "Death" a possible alternative. Then let us have
"Death before Slavery," by all means. At present, <i>Punch</i> would
say, "Common-sense before either!"</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Ah!
but you didn't do much
rowing then. You let me
get all the blisters, and you
just sat in the stern and
steered us like a blessed
corkscrew.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Did I?
I didn't remember that;
but I do remember you
catching about half-a-dozen crabs one after another.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> True enough I caught one, but that was because
you would keep standing up in the boat, and moving your body
backwards and forwards. I suppose you thought the coxswains do
that in their racing-boats?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>boldly</i>). They do. I've seen 'em doing it often.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why, I thought you'd never seen the crews at all.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Bosh! I never said anything of the kind. I'm
not going to see the race this year, but I've often seen 'em practising
down at Putney. Everybody knows the coxswains have to stand up.
How do you suppose they could see to steer if they didn't? So
where are you now, with all your accurate information, eh?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> I'm where I was before, and I know I'm right,
because my brother-in-law had a cousin who was at school with one
of the Coxes about ten years ago. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>looking up from his sporting paper</i>). I say, I thought
the crews rowed in racing-boats.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> So they do.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Well, then, what does this mean? (<i>Reads.</i>) "Both
yesterday and to-day Cambridge rowed with a bucket. They must
improve this if they want to win."</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). My dear fellow, they call their big
practising-boat a bucket.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, they don't&mdash;they call it a tub.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, tub or bucket, it's the same thing. (<i>To</i>
Inquirer.) What you read just now means that their practising-boat
has gone rotten, and they'll have to mend her up a bit.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). But they don't row the race in a tub or a
bucket, do they?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, they row in a Clinker-Clasper.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What the deuce is that?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>plunging</i>). Oh, it's a specially fast kind of
racing-boat, built by <span class="sc">Clinker and Clasper</span>. They're a firm of
boat-builders&mdash;I thought everybody knew that.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But then, what does this paper mean by saying that
Oxford are rowing in a Rough?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why it means that their boat isn't so smooth as
that of Cambridge.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). But then it goes on to say that "She is as
fine a specimen of a racing-craft as this eminent boat-builder has
ever turned out." How can she be that, if she isn't as smooth as the
Cambridge boat? Besides, who's "this eminent boat-builder?"</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> <span class="sc">Rough</span>.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Rot!</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> <span class="sc">Rough</span>, not Rot. <span class="sc">Rough's</span> his name.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Let me see the paper. (<i>He reads, and
addresses the</i> Inquirer.) Why didn't you say the word was printed
with a capital R? (<i>To</i> Average Man.) Perhaps you're right, after
all; but I know some boats <i>are</i> rougher than others. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What's the difference between First Trinity and Third
Trinity? Three of the Cambridge men are from First Trinity, and
two from Third Trinity, besides the Cox.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What's your difficulty? First is first, and
Third's third, all the world over. Don't you see, the First Trinity
men come first in the crew, and then the Third Trinity men.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But why don't some of 'em call themselves Second
Trinity men?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, that's one of their silly bits of College
etiquette. These chaps at the Universities are never happy unless
they do things quite differently from all the rest of the world.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> This beastly paper says, "the Cambridge stroke rowed
much longer to-day."</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, what then?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Oh! nothing; only I thought they all rowed exactly
the same distance when they're practising; so I don't quite see how
any of 'em could have rowed longer than the rest.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I daresay they made him row a good bit by himself;
they often do that to give the stroke some extra practice. He
wants it more than any of the rest.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, ah&mdash;well, because he's got to set the stroke
for the others, or something of that sort.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> How far do they row in the race?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> About six miles or so.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> By Jove, then, how on earth do they manage to get
over all that distance with so few strokes. (<i>Refers to paper.</i>) It
says, "Oxford rowed 37 all the way, while Cambridge contented
themselves with a well-pulled 35." (<i>With a happy inspiration.</i>) If
Cambridge can do it in 35 strokes, while Oxford take 37, it looks
jolly like Cambridge winning by two strokes, don't it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> All right; I'll lay you the odds on Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Good, I'll take 'em to five pounds. Oxford
can't win.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>confidently</i>). Cambridge can't win. Anyway,
I'll lay you ten pounds to five.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I should like to have a bet with somebody.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> You'd better write to one of the Presidents of
the University-Boat Clubs. They're always ready to oblige a keen
fellow like you with a bet.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course. That's my best plan. I'll write to-day.</p>

[In a recent trial, Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Hawkins</span> corrected a learned Counsel who
talked about Witnesses "coming up to the scratch."]
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>taking his seat</i>). I think, Mr. <span class="sc">Smallfee</span>, that
you
were examining a Witness when we adjourned yesterday. Are you
ready to go on with the examination?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>pleasantly</i>). I am sorry to say that Witness has not
turned up yet, m'Lud!</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>pained</i>). Not <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee.</i> I beg your Lordship's pardon. Of course what I
<i>meant</i> was that the Witness has not, as yet, condescended to irradiate
the precincts of this tribunal with the sunshine of his presence.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> <i>That's</i> better! Then we must go on to the next
Witness.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>with an evident attempt to keep up his spirits, in
spite of misfortune</i>). The next Witness, also, I regret to say, has not
turned&mdash;&mdash;I mean, has failed to appear. The Solicitor informs
me that he solemnly promised to attend; but I suppose the promise
was all my eye.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Dear, dear! What extraordinary expressions you do
use, Mr. <span class="sc">Smallfee</span>! All my eye! Perhaps you will kindly interpret
the phrase, for the benefit of the Court.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>desperately</i>). As your Lordship pleases! But, as
I feel rather down in the mouth now, and as the twelve sufferers
in the Jury-box evidently think that this trial has lasted long
enough already, and that we ought to stir our stumps, I would
suggest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Usher! Step across to Booksellers' Row, and buy me a
Slang Dictionary! I cannot&mdash;I really <i>cannot</i> follow the learned
Counsel.</p>

<p><i>The Foreman</i> (<i>interposing</i>). <i>We</i> do not object to colloquial
expressions,
my Lord. Y' see, we're a <i>Common</i> Jury, and we rather like
them. All we want to do is to get on with the case. And perhaps
it may assist the Court if at this stage I remark that the Jury has
quite made up its mind, and is ready to give its verdict.</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>astounded</i>). But&mdash;but&mdash;there has been no evidence
for the defence!</p>

<p><i>The Foreman</i> (<i>calmly</i>). No, my Lord. But no doubt the learned
Counsel's two Witnesses, had they been present, would have
supplied some; and, anyhow, we are so pleased with his talking down
to our level, and not&mdash;as usual&mdash;over our heads, that we are all
agreed to find a verdict for his client, the Defendant.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>bowing</i>). Thanks for your good opinion, Gentlemen.

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">Extracted From the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night,
March 13.</i>&mdash;No use disguising fact that when
House discovered <span class="sc">Frederick Milner</span> standing
behind Front Opposition Bench, brandishing
heavy boot in his hand as he addressed
<span class="sc">Asquith</span>, it held its breath. Political passion
runs pretty high of late; Opposition stirred
to deepest depths by persistence of Government
in attempting to read Home-Rule Bill
Second Time before Easter. There have
been sittings after midnight; sittings through
Saturday; hot words bandied about; preparation
for deadly duel in lobby. No one
can say whither men may be led when once
they permit angry passions to rise. <span class="sc">Charles
Russell</span>, whose acquaintance with criminal
classes is extensive, tells me it is by no means
uncommon thing for prisoner in dock to take
off boot and hurl it at head of presiding
Magistrate or Judge.</p>

<p>"Usually an old woman who does it," he
added.</p>

<p>"But this is Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Milner</span>,
Bart.," I said.</p>

<p>"Um!" said <span class="sc">Russell</span>, with odd significance
in the observation.</p>

<p>Turns out the apprehension groundless.
<span class="sc">Milner</span> only wants to know why Police at
Leeds and Bradford should enjoy ultimate resources
of civilisation in respect of "<span class="sc">Scaith's</span>
silent boots," whilst London Policemen not so
privileged? <span class="sc">Milner</span> tells me his earliest idea
was to get a pair of the boots, put 'em on, and
surprise <span class="sc">Speaker</span> by approaching with noiseless
tread from behind Chair, lean over his
shoulder, and suddenly say, "Boo!" That,
<span class="sc">Milner</span> thought, would be conclusive proof
of the efficacy of the boots as making the
tread inaudible. On other hand, <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
mightn't like it. So, by way of compromise,
brought down odd boot in tail-pocket of his
coat, and shook it at <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> when
he put question.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Asquith</span> behaved very well under trying
circumstances. Did not visibly blench;
answered, in off-hand manner, that London
Police had had opportunity of substituting
the silent boot for those in ordinary use, and
had not availed themselves of it. Some had
objected on domestic grounds. Female friends
engaged in responsible posts in certain households
on their beat were accustomed to the
sound of their footfall on the pavement, and
would not have things ready if they approached
like rose-leaves flitting over shaven
lawns. Others, assuming higher ground,
resented silent boot as taking unfair advantage
of the burglar or footpad. "Give a 'ardworking
cove a fair chanst, that's my motter,"
one honest fellow in blue said to <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span>
when Right Hon. Gentleman brought
silent boot under his notice. No use attempting
to run counter to feeling of this kind.
Conclusion in which <span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span> heartily
concurred.</p>

<p>"Silent boot," he said, "forced upon Metropolitan
Police might play in history a part
analogous to that of the greased cartridges
on which we slipped into the Indian Mutiny."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Milner</span> saw it was evidently no use, so returning
boot to coat-tail pocket, moodily
regarded Treasury Bench.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/143.png"><img src="images/143-600.png" width="600" height="436" alt="'WANTING TO KNOW;' OR, THE BEWILDERED USHER." /></a>
<h3>"WANTING TO KNOW;" OR, THE BEWILDERED USHER.</h3></div>

<p>But there were consolations. <span class="sc">Squire</span> of
<span class="sc">Malwood</span>, asked by Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> what he
now thought of prospects of reading Home-Rule
Bill Second Time before Easter, admitted
impossibility; triumphant shout from Opposition.
Not in vain had they sat through
morning sitting on Friday discussing the
hour at which they should adjourn on Saturday.
Not without recompense had they
taken care that when Saturday came it should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>
see accomplished the minimum of business. Tussling with Mr. G.
ever since Session opened; in first rounds he came off best; drew
first blood; seemed likely to carry everything with him; Opposition
pulled themselves together; went at it hammer and tongs; and
now it is Mr. G. who has retired to corner; the sponge is in
requisition on the Treasury Bench; the air around it redolent of
the perfume of the indispensable vinegar.</p>

<p>"Guinness will go up a point or two on this," said <span class="sc">Ellis Ashmead
Bartlett</span>, Knight, who has taken Irish securities under his wing.
"Go down a pint or two, you mean," said <span class="sc">Wilfrid Lawson</span>, who is
irreclaimable.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Attack on Justice <span class="sc">Mathew</span> and Evicted Tenants'
Commission repulsed by 287 Votes against 250.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> a changed man. No longer
the
light-hearted, sometimes almost frivolous youth who through six
years sat on Front Opposition Bench, and girded at the Unionist
Government. A Minister himself now; Mr. G.'s right-hand man;
First Lieutenant of the Ship of State; acting Captain when,
as happens just now, Mr. G. temporarily turned in. Once this afternoon
something of old spirit stirred within him when <span class="sc">Howard
Vincent</span> (as he said) used the Stationary Vote as a peg on which to
hang Protection heresies. But, for most part, he sits silent and self-communing,
saying nothing, but, probably, like the parrot of old,
thinking the more. In Conservative ranks feeling of profound
respect growing in his favour. Curious to hear them say, "Ah! if
everyone on Treasury Bench bore himself like <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>, things
would be different." Even the blameless <span class="sc">Bryce</span> is held up to
contumely in contrast with mild-mannered <span class="sc">Master</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span>. As
for <span class="sc">Charles Russell</span>, after his speech last night, good Conservatives,
following an Eastern custom, well enough in its place, spit when
they mention his name. For them the model of all Parliamentary
virtue is the <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span>.</p>

<p>Don't know how long this passion of appreciation will last; interesting
to observe while yet with us. A lull all round in sympathy
with soothing moments of <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of <span class="sc">Exchequer</span>. Even J. W.
<span class="sc">Lowther's</span> perturbed mind at rest. Knows now, to a fraction, how
many lead-pencils are annually in use in directing destinies of
British Empire. Rumour current that origin of this inquiry was a
little undertaking promoted by Hon. Member in substitution of proscribed
word-guessing competitions. Sweep got up; &pound;5 entry; every
man to guess at precise figure of lead-pencil census; the one coming
nearest to clear the pool. <span class="sc">Lowther</span> tells me not word of truth in
report. In putting his question as to number of lead-pencils in use,
and in sticking to it in spite of jeers of bystanders and guilty
reticence of Minister, he was actuated simply by motives of public
policy; desired, in short, to live up to standard of late lamented
Leader and do his duty to his <span class="sc">Queen</span> and Country.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Great lead-pencil question settled. Excited
House Counted Out at 9.20.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/144a.png"><img src="images/144a-500.png" width="500" height="307" alt="'Back!! Rasch intruder!'" /></a>
<h3>"Back!! Rasch intruder!"</h3></div>

<p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;House
dying to know what Major
<span class="sc">Frederick Carne Rasch</span>
had to say on Navy Estimates.
Not being Major of
Marines, initial difficulty is
to imagine what he did in
this galley. If it had been the Army, or even the Militia, the
Major would have seemed all right. But what had he to do with
the Navy? That, however, is for the Major a minor point. "You
<span class="sc">Carne</span> be too <span class="sc">Rasch</span> when attacking this Government," said
<span class="sc">Kenyon</span>,
with his pretty elliptical speech.</p>

<p>It was half-past ten, and a dull night. Navy Estimates been
talked round for nearly five hours. <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> meekly
hoped that a Vote would now be taken; <span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span> presented
himself at footlights with bewitching smile on his lips and elegantly
bound gilt-edged volume under his arm; bowed to audience;
opened volume; proceeding to offer few remarks when <span class="sc">Squire</span>
swooped down on him with Closure.</p>

<p>This was cue for <span class="sc">Rasch</span>. Chairman rose to put question. So did
<span class="sc">Rasch</span>. Closure must not be debated; attempt to speak is unpardonable
breach of order. The Major stood in the imminent
deadly breach; House howled; Chairman cried, "Order! Order!"
<span class="sc">Rasch</span> glared round, and, after moment's hesitation, sat down; up
again as soon as Question was put; howls more anguished than
ever. Committee having agreed that Question be put, nothing to
do but put it, and here was <span class="sc">Rasch</span> bubbling over with speech.
Chairman on his feet peremptorily signalling Major to sit down;
Members near him tugged at his coat-tails; those further off
frantically wave deprecatory hands. Major stood to his guns;
shouts of "Name! Name!" Chairman, desperately pegging
away, succeeded in putting Question, being money-vote for Navy.
Major by this time hauled down in his seat. Up again, like Jack
out of box. Chairman also on his feet, putting next vote; hubbub
tremendous; Major's lips observed in motion; not an articulate
syllable rose above uproar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/144b.png"><img src="images/144b-350.png" width="350" height="300" alt="On the Stroke of Twelve; or, Cinderella Balfour!" /></a>
<h3>On the Stroke of Twelve; or, Cinderella Balfour!</h3></div>

<p>Meanwhile Chairman had dexterously put and run through
supplementary vote for Excess of Expenditure;
friends near him had got the catapultic Major
down again, in time to hear Chairman declare
"the Ayes have it!" Major up again. "Order!
order!" shouted the Chairman. "Question:
is&mdash;&mdash;" Not quite clear amid uproar what question
was; something to do with Army. Anyhow,
there was <span class="sc">Stanhope</span> standing at table
discussing Army Votes. Major again on his feet,
his moustache twitching with astonishment.
<span class="sc">Stanhope</span> a peculiarly painful circumstance; all
very well for good Conservative to gird against
Government, and jostle Mr. G.'s Chairman of
Committees; different (especially for a Major in
the Militia) to struggle with Statesman who
had been Secretary of State for War on his own
side. So Major, defiantly glaring round House slowly dropped into
his seat:&mdash;"dying with all his music in him," as <span class="sc">Justin McCarthy</span>,
who knows the poets, said. But what was the tune he meditated?
What is the secret of this unspoken speech?</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Money voted for Naval men. Halt cried on Army
Vote.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Rasch</span> broken out again; turns up as usual at critical
moment. Committee of Supply adjourned at ten minutes to seven;
sharp at seven morning sitting must be suspended. Report of
Supply under consideration; only tremulous ten minutes to get
through it. <span class="sc">Rasch</span> resolved, now or never, to finish the speech he
commenced yesterday. House, after protest, settles down to listen.
Seems <span class="sc">Kay Shuttleworth</span> been "saying things" about the
warrior. "He behaved towards me," said the Major, "in a manner
that would be brusque on the part of Providence addressing a black
beetle." House undecided as to which simile more happily
bestowed. On the whole, agreed more polite to contemplate
<span class="sc">U. Kay Shuttleworth</span> as Providence, than Major <span class="sc">Rasch</span> as the
other thing.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Some Votes in Supply.</p>
